# Ethereum Mom

> Ethereum Mom aims at making Ethereum Smart Contracts development fun and easy. Enjoy a relaxed approach, with answers that you'd only dare to get from your Mom because you think you should know them.

## Contributing

This project is fully open to external contributions, so all can join the fun.

Contributing with your curated Solidity and JavaScript use cases is fairly simple. Check out the [snippets file in this repo](https://github.com/thomasvds/ethereum-mom/blob/master/src/data/snippets.js). After you've understood the (fairly simple) syntax and elements of new snippets, feel free to create a Pull Request so you contribution can be integrated and deployed.

Please do integrate no more than one additional use case per Pull Request, to ease the review.

Don't forget to add your GitHub username in your snippet contribution, so it can be referenced accordingly.

Thanks and spread the Ethereum Love !
